##  Bacterial Transformation

## Introduction

This is a general protocol for bacterial transformation.  It is applicable for re-transforming plasmids, traditional cloning, TA-cloning, gateway cloning, etc.  Refer to specific product information for more details if necessary.

The effective concentration of your plasmid and the competency of your cells will determine the number of colonies you can expect.  When re-transforming plasmids, the effective concentration is very high, so ultra highly competent cells are not needed.  If this is all that are available, then volume plated should be less.  By contrast, the effective concentration of a gateway cloning product is very low, so ultra highly competent cells are needed.

## Materials
* DNA
* Competent cells 
  * E.g.:  One Shot Top 10 Chemically competent E. Coli, Invitrogen C404003
* SOC media
* Appropriate antibiotic selection plate

## Protocol

1.  [ ] Thaw competent cells on ice.
2.  [ ] Add 1-2uL DNA solution to the cells and gently mix.  Do not vortex.
3.  [ ] Incubate on ice for 30 min.
4.  [ ] Heat shock for 30 sec at 40C.
5.  [ ] Add 250 uL SOC media immediately.
6.  [ ] Tape tube horizontally to the floor of the incubator and shake 1 hr at 37C.
7.  [ ] Pre-warm plate at 37C.
8.  [ ] After shaking, add appropriate volume of culture to the selection plate.  This may range from 25-250 uL.  Add additional SOC to bring the total volume on the plate to 250 uL.
9.  [ ] Add 10-15 autoclaved glass balls.  Shake to spread the culture evenly.  Put the used glass balls in the dirty beaker.
10. [ ] Incubate overnight at 37C.
