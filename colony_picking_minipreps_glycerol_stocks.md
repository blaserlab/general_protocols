##  Colony Picking, Minipreps, and Making Glycerol Stocks

## Introduction

This protocol starts with bacterial colonies on a plate.  They can come from transformation or from streaking out a glycerol stock. Colonies should be well-separated and should not have satellite colonies.

You will want to pick a few colonies at minimum if possible.  Pick more if the cloning is low-efficiency.

## Materials
* colonies on plates 
* LB broth
* 1000X antibiotic for selection
* ZR Plasmid Miniprep - Classic kit
* bacterial culture tubes

## Protocol

1.  [ ] Label an appropriate number of culture tubes.
2.  [ ] Add 2-5 mL LB broth to each tube
3.  [ ] Add the appropriate amount of 1000X selection antibiotic
4.  [ ] Pick an appropriate number of well-spaced colonies off of selection plate using a p2 or p20 pipette tip.
5.  [ ] Eject 1 tip into each tube
6.  [ ] Incubate overnight at 37C with shaking
7.  [ ] Collect 1.5-4 mL culture in eppendorf tubes by repeatedly spinning at top speed for 20 sec and pouring off supernatant. Reserve 0.5 mL culture for the gylycerol stocks.
8.  [ ] Put the reserved culture in the 4C refrigerator
9.  [ ] Add 200 uL P1 buffer (red) and resuspend.
10. [ ] Add 200 uL P2 buffer (green) and mix by inverting 2-4 times.  The solution should turn purple and viscous.  Proceed immediatly to the next step.
11. [ ] Add 400 uL P3 buffer and mix throroughly but don't vortex.  Incubate RT 1-2 min.
12. [ ] Centrifuge x 2 min at max speed.
13. [ ] Put a spin column in a collection tube.  Label the tubes.  Pour the supernatant into the column.
14. [ ] Centrifuge max speed 30 sec.  Discard flow through.
15. [ ] Add 200 uL endo-wash buffer.  Centrifuge max speed x 30 sec.  Discard flow through.
16. [ ] Add 400 uL plasmid wash buffer.  Centrifuge max speed x 1 min.  Discard flow through.
17. [ ] Transfer column to a clean 1.5 mL eppendorf tube.  Add 30-50 uL elution buffer or water to the membrane.  Centrifuge 30 sec to elute plasmid DNA.
18. [ ] Validate DNA specimen by restriction digest with or without full plasmid sequencing. 
19. [ ] Make the glycerol stock:  mix 0.5 mL culture with 0.5 mL 50% glycerol in a cryotube.
20. [ ] Update the plasmid catalog.  Label the cryotube with the pBL serial number on the top and write a descriptive name on the side.
21. [ ] Store in -80.
