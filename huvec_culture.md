##  HUVEC Cell Culture

## Introduction

This is the basic protocol for culturing HUVEC cells and E4-HUVEC cells.  For dox-inducible E4, be sure to add doxycycline at the indicated concentration to the media.

## Materials

| **Reagent** 	| **Catalog Number **| **Storage**|      
|---------------|-----------------------|------------|
| HUVEC cells 	| Fisher C01510C or lab stock	| LN Freezer - Hope|	
| EGM-2 Medium 	| Lonza CC-3162 	|4C|
| Supplements 	| same 	|-20C|
| TrypLE Express (Trypsin-EDTA)	|  Gibco 12605010 |-20C/4C|
| Doxycycline	| Stem Cell Technologies 72742 |-20C/4C|

## Media Preparation

1.  [ ] Thaw supplement kit reagents in a 37°C water bath. Do not leave reagents in the bath once thawed. 
2.  [ ] Wipe the outside of all components with 70% ethanol solution. 
3.  [ ] Add all kit components to a fresh bottle of EGM-2 starting with serum.
4.  [ ] Add antibiotics or antimycotics if being used in the media. 
5.  [ ] Mix gently. Careful not to produce foam.
6.  [ ] Media bottle should be wiped with 70% ethanol after use and stored at 4°C. 
7.  [ ] For studies using dox-inducible cells, add doxycycline for a final concentration of 2 ug/mL. 

## Thawing Cells

1.  [ ] Hand-warm a vial of HUVEC cells from the LN freezer. Warm medium to 37C.
2.  [ ] When thawed, decontaminate the vial by spraying with ethanol and transfer to a 15 cc falcon tube 
3.  [ ] Slowly (drop by drop) add 10 mL warm medium.
4.  [ ] Gently mix by inverting. 
6.  [ ] Using a sterile pipette, withdraw ~0.25 mL cells for counting
7.  [ ] Mix 15 uL cells and 15 uL trypan blue and count on the countess instrument. 
8.  [ ] Spin down the cells while counting at 1000g x 7 min.
9.  [ ] Calculate area for culture.  Target 20,000 cells/cm^2.  See this [useful guide for cell culture vessel areas and recommended seeding density.](https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/references/gibco-cell-culture-basics/cell-culture-protocols/cell-culture-useful-numbers.html).
10.  [ ] Resuspend cells in appropriate volume of EGM2 media and plate.
11.  [ ] Incubate flasks at 37°C with 5% CO2. 
12.  [ ] Check cell confluency each day in brightfield or fluorescence if applicable using the cell culture microscope. 
13.  [ ] Change growth media when it has turned from pink to yellow/orange. 
  *  HUVEC cells are adherent to the plate. 
  *  Remove media with a single-use sterile pipette. 
  *  Replace with warmed growth media in a new sterile pipette. 
14. [ ] Split cells when the concentration reaches 85-90% confluence. 

## Splitting Cells

1.  [ ] If cells need to be split into more groups after initial growth, remove the growth media from the flask. 
2.  [ ] Wash the dish/flask with enough trypsin/edta to cover the cells x 1.
3.  [ ] Add the amount of fresh trypsin/edta. Incubate in hood 1-3 minutes.
4.  [ ] Tap flask against your hand  or something to slough cells from the bottom of the flask. 
5.  [ ] When media appears foggy, quench the reaction with fresh complete media, approximately 10 mL is plenty. 
6.  [ ] Spin conical tubes at 4°C for 5 minutes at 1000g.
7.  [ ] Aspirate supernatant and discard. 
8.  [ ] Re-suspend cells in complete EGM2 media.  Volume to be calculated as appropriate.
9. [ ] Incubate flasks at 37°C with 5% CO2.
